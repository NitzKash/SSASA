Note:

the program will ask for password and name at initial stage...

each name will have a unique password...


initially, only two sets are possible: 

1. name- nishant
   password- kalita

2. name- nitish
   password- kashyap



it is important to note that name, 'nitish' and password, 'kalita' 
as a set will be treated as a password mismatch

also, after creating a new record from the program and exitting, that record
can be used be used as a correct set of 'name' and 'password'
(provieded the file which gets created/modified during the program run is not altered
after exitting the program and that the new record was not deleted (expeled) 
after its creation (addition))
